      Over the years and through new game releases, the Animal Crossing menu has evolved from
      simple treats to more detailed and delicious meals. In the early games, food options were
      mostly limited to fruits like apples, pears, oranges, coconuts, and mushrooms, while candy
      was later added during special events like Halloween. In Animal Crossing: New Horizons the
      food choices expanded significantly, providing players with a variety of appetizing dishes.
      This new feature encourages players to collect ingredients and cook their own delicious
      meals, with choices including pizza, salads, tarts, noodles, pancakes, spaghetti, and more.

      The menu also showcases foods from different cultures and countries, such as biryani,
      Champi√±ones al Ajillo, hearty ramen, nigirizushi, pad krapow, and many others. Players can
      also enjoy savoury beverages like various flavours of bubble tea, juices, sodas, lattes,
      coffee, and tea. For dessert lovers, there are treats like ice cream, donuts, frozen treats,
      cotton candy, cakes, pies, and cupcakes. Overall, the menu is diverse and fun, allowing
      players to explore new dishes and customize their meals every day, making for a more
      interactive and enjoyable experience.
