    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Animal Crossing is an open-world life simulation game where players have the freedom to do
      whatever they want. The game begins with the main character, a villager, living among
      animals. The player can build relationships with these animals and interact with their
      surroundings. Since the game has no set objectives, the main character is free to engage in
      a variety of activities, such as designing their village, collecting items, socializing with
      villagers, and paying off the loan on their house. This lack of specific goals gives the
      player freedom to shape their own world as they please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having grown up with Animal Crossing, I find its world to be a peaceful escape from the
      troubles of real life. The music, openness, and freedom provide a sense of relief allowing
      players to build a village that expresses themselves without any stress. Interacting with
      the villagers fosters connection, making it feel like youâ€™re spending time with friends. You
      can also visit other towns and interact with players worldwide. This can help inspire the
      way one creates their world. Players can also sell items, earn money, travel to other
      worlds, and interact with fellow players. Animal Crossing encourages creativity, letting one
      shape their world without any pressure or expectations.
