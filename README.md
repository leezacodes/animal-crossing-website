This is the first website I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, dedicated to my favorite childhood game. It highlights the evolution of the game series, 
from the original Animal Forest to New Horizons. The site explores various aspects of the game, including attractions, foods, and in-game events, 
showcasing its charm and beauty throughout the years.
